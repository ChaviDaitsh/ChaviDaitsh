About Me

I'm a passionate and dedicated software engineer with a strong background in both backend and full-stack development. I thrive on tackling challenging projects and enjoy working on various aspects of web development. My journey in the tech world has been fueled by excellent self-learning abilities, demonstrated by my independent mastery of new subjects through online courses during my studies. I am actively seeking a development position in a professional environment where I can leverage my skills and contribute to continuous professional growth.
